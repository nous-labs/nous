# @nouslabs/core

The `@nouslabs/core` package exposes the foundational utilities that keep the Qubic TypeScript ecosystem consistent across clients, SDKs, and integrations. Everything from identity encoding to low-level cryptography originates here.

## When to use it

- Build custom tooling on top of Qubic primitives.
- Audit or extend the helpers that higher level packages consume.
- Share consistent serialization logic between browser, server, and Node runtimes.

## What's inside

- Identity helpers for converting between base26, bytes, and checksum-safe strings.
- Keccak and KangarooTwelve hashing utilities optimised for Qubic payloads.
- Deterministic seed derivation helpers used by the SDK, CLI, and React integrations.
- Strict input validation schemas for transactions, smart-contract payloads, and configuration.

## Related packages

- [`@nouslabs/sdk`](/docs) consumes these primitives to build rich client utilities.
- [`@nouslabs/react`](/docs/integrations) wraps the core logic with React hooks and providers.
- [`@nouslabs/cli`](/docs/cli) relies on shared serialization and validation for secure workflows.
