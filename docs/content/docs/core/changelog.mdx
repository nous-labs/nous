# @nouslabs/core changelog

Track notable changes to the cryptography, validation, and identity helpers that sit underneath the SDK and CLI packages.

## 2025-10-29

### Improved

- Expanded validation utilities to support richer identity parsing and tick safety checks used by the CLI.
- Consolidated shared helpers (`promptOrCancel`, balance guards, and seeding utilities) so higher-level packages reuse the same resilient code paths.

## 1.4.0 · 2025-01-26

- Updated package branding from `@nvlabs/qts` to `@nouslabs/core` alongside the SDK rename.
- Released a unified authentication surface for seed, vault, MetaMask Snap, and WalletConnect flows, powered by shared cryptographic primitives.

## 1.2.x · 2025-10-25

- Strengthened encoding/decoding helpers for smart-contract payloads and account management.
- Added batch account creation helpers and stricter identity validation routines.
