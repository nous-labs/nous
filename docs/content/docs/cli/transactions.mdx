# Transactions

Think of the CLI transaction commands as wagmiâ€™s actions adapted to the terminal. They enforce interactive reviews and password prompts by default.

## Quick transfer

```bash
nous send transfer <destination> <amount>
```

Options:

- `--from <identity>`: override the current account.
- `--tick <number>` or `--tick-offset <number>`: control scheduling.
- `--skip-review`: skip the preflight summary (still prompts for a password).

## Sign without broadcasting

```bash
nous transactions sign <destination> <amount> --output signed.txt
```

- Unlocks the vault (or requests a seed) to sign the payload.
- Writes the base64 encoded transaction to `signed.txt`.
- Combine with `nous transactions broadcast --file signed.txt` on another machine for offline signing.

## Broadcast an existing payload

```bash
nous transactions broadcast --file signed.txt
```

Reads a base64 file, validates that it is decodable, and pushes it to the live network.

## Inspect transactions

```bash
nous tx --limit 10
nous tx-hash <hash>
```

Fetch recent activity for the current identity or a provided address. Use `--json` to integrate with scripts.

## Asset helpers

```bash
nous assets issued <identity>
nous assets owned <identity>
nous assets possessed <identity>
```

Map asset holdings directly from the command line when building portfolio tooling.

## Password confirmations

Every signing or broadcasting command prompts for the vault password unless the seed exists only in memory. Expect to see:

- Password hint (if set).
- 3 attempts before the operation aborts.
- Option to keep seeds session-only when a vault is unavailable.
