# Security practices

The CLI is designed around the encrypted seed vault introduced in `@nouslabs/sdk`. Use the patterns below to keep your identities safe.

## Vault-first mindset

- Store every seed in the encrypted vault unless you are performing a one-off transfer.
- Create a strong password (8+ characters, ideally with passphrase-style entropy). The CLI enforces minimum length but you should aim higher.
- Set a memorable, non-sensitive password hint. The hint is stored in plain text to help jog your memory, not to expose the password.

```bash
nous account create
# â†’ prompts for password, confirmation, and optional hint
```

## Confirm every sensitive action

- The CLI prompts for the vault password whenever you sign or broadcast.
- If a session seed is only in memory, you must still confirm that you want to proceed without vault storage.
- When using `nous send transfer`, review the summary before approving. Declining returns you to the terminal without broadcasting.

## Session hygiene

- `nous auth logout` clears the selected identity and any seeds cached for the session.
- Running `nous config reset` removes all configuration files, password hints, and cached seeds. Use it when rotating machines.
- For scripts, export `NOUS_CONFIG_DIR` to isolate configuration per environment.

## Offline signing workflow

For higher assurance, split signing and broadcasting across machines.

1. On an air-gapped machine:

   ```bash
   nous transactions sign <to> <amount> --output signed.txt
   ```

2. Transfer `signed.txt` to an online machine.
3. Broadcast from the online machine:

   ```bash
   nous send from-file signed.txt
   ```

The vault password is required during the signing step only, keeping your sensitive material off the networked host.

## Rotating vault passwords

To rotate, unlock the vault, export seeds, and re-encrypt:

```bash
nous auth login          # unlock with old password
nous account list        # ensure identities are loaded
nous account create --no-store  # optional, generates a temporary seed
# Recreate the vault by calling reset + login
nous config reset
nous auth login          # create a fresh password when prompted
```

Store the updated password in a secure manager immediately. Without the password you cannot decrypt stored seeds.
