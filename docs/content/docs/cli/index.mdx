# @nouslabs/cli

The `@nouslabs/cli` package is a batteries-included command-line interface for interacting with the Qubic network. It layers on top of `@nouslabs/sdk` and `@nouslabs/core`, giving developers a secure way to manage accounts, sign transactions, and broadcast activity directly from the terminal.

## Highlights

- Encrypted seed vault with password re-authentication for every sensitive action.
- Account lifecycle commands (`list`, `create`, `import`, `remove`) that mirror the SDK data structures.
- Transaction utilities for preparing, signing, inspecting, and broadcasting transfers.
- Monitoring dashboards for ticks, computors, and network status.
- Configurable RPC endpoints and network presets to match local or remote environments.

## Next steps

- Run `npx @nouslabs/cli --help` to explore every command.
