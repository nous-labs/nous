# Getting started with the CLI

The CLI layers on top of the shared SDK and core packages. Before issuing commands, make sure you have the right runtime, package manager, and a safe configuration directory.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or Bun 1.1+ (the repo uses Bun for local development, but the published package works with `npm` or `pnpm`).
- A Qubic identity or seed you can import.
- Optional: a password hint for your encrypted vault.

## Install globally

```bash
npm install -g @nouslabs/cli
# or
bun add -g @nouslabs/cli
```

After installation, confirm the binary is available:

```bash
nous --version
```

If you prefer not to install globally, use `npx @nouslabs/cli <command>` instead.

## Link during local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nous-labs/sdk.git
cd sdk/packages/cli
bun install
bun run build
npm link
```

The `npm link` step exposes the built CLI as a global binary referencing your local checkout.

## First-time configuration

1. Run `nous auth login` and provide your seed or encrypted vault credentials.
2. Store the seed in the encrypted vault when prompted. Every signing action will require the password.
3. Select a default identity:

```bash
nous account list
nous account select
```

4. Optionally set a custom RPC endpoint:

```bash
nous config set rpcEndpoint https://rpc.qubic.org
```

With these steps complete you can start querying network data, preparing transactions, or broadcasting transfers from the same shell session. Each secure action will require your vault password to confirm intent.
