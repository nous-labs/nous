# @nouslabs/cli changelog

Stay up to date with the latest enhancements to the Nous Labs CLI experience.

## 2025-10-29

### Added

- Interactive REPL mode (`nous` with no arguments) for staying inside the CLI until you exit.
- Inline quick references at the prompt so you always know the most useful commands.

### Improved

- Transfer workflow now validates account balances before signing and keeps ticks â‰¥ latest+5 to avoid stale broadcasts.
- Post-broadcast confirmation watcher waits for real network progress and offers safe rebroadcast options when the chain advances.
- Monitoring dashboard switched to high-density HUD cards with ASCII sparklines and contract hotlists.

### Fixed

- Seed vault only prompts once per sensitive action, even when you perform multiple operations in sequence.
- Confirmation watcher no longer floods the network with retries when the ledger is stalled.
- REPL gracefully handles cancelled prompts and command errors without dropping back to the OS shell.
