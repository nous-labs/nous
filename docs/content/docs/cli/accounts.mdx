# Account management

The CLI mirrors wagmi-style account helpers: generate seeds, import vaults, and switch identities from the terminal.

## Create a seed

```bash
nous account create
```

- Prompts for a label.
- Optionally stores the seed in the encrypted vault.
- Offers to set the new account as current.

Pass flags when scripting:

```bash
nous account create --label "Ops wallet" --no-store --no-select
```

## Import an existing account

```bash
nous account import
```

- Choose `seed` to type or paste a 55+ character seed.
- Choose `vault` to register a vaulted identity and label.

Seed imports prompt to encrypt the seed immediately. Vault imports keep the account metadata without storing the private material.

## List & select

```bash
nous account list
nous account select
```

`list` shows:

- Label and identity (truncated).
- Whether the encrypted seed exists.
- Whether the seed is loaded in memory for the session.

`select` presents an interactive picker to set `currentIdentity`.

## Remove an account

```bash
nous account remove
```

If the account has an encrypted seed, the CLI asks for the vault password and deletes it from disk.

## Session hygiene

```bash
nous auth logout
```

Removes the current identity from `.nouslabs-cli` config and clears any seeds cached in memory. Combine with `nous config reset` to wipe the entire CLI state for a workstation.
