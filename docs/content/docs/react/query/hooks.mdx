# Core hooks

These hooks wrap the live, query, and archive clients from `@nouslabs/sdk`, giving you instant access to network data with TanStack Query.

| Hook | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `useCurrentTick()` | Fetches the latest tick info and refreshes every second. |
| `useTick(tickNumber)` | Retrieves historical tick data through the archive service. |
| `useTransactionsForIdentity(identity)` | Streams paginated transactions for a specific identity. |
| `useBalance(identity)` | Loads QUBIC balances along with the tick they were observed. |
| `useComputorList(epoch?)` | Fetches computor lists for a given epoch. |
| `useEntity(identity)` | Convenience query combining entity data and transactions. |
| `useArchivedTick(tickNumber)` | Archived variant of `useTick()` pinned for historical analysis. |
| `useBroadcastTransaction()` | Mutation wrapper for broadcasting pre-signed payloads. |
| `useProcedureCall()` | Mutation helper for experimental procedure calls (requires wallet support). |
| `useTickPoller(intervalMs?)` | Polls `useCurrentTick` on an interval. |
| `useBalancePoller(identity, intervalMs?)` | Polls balances on a schedule for lightweight dashboards. |

All hooks return the standard TanStack Query results (`status`, `data`, `error`, etc.), so you can plug them straight into Suspense, optimistic updates, or any cache patterns you already use.

## Usage example

```tsx
import { useBalance } from "@nouslabs/react/query";

function BalanceCard({ identity }: { identity: string }) {
  const balanceQuery = useBalance(identity);

  if (balanceQuery.isLoading) return <p>Loading…</p>;
  if (balanceQuery.error) return <p>Unable to load balance</p>;

  const amount = Number(balanceQuery.data?.balance ?? 0).toLocaleString();
  return <span>{amount} QUBIC</span>;
}
```
