# React Query overview

`@nouslabs/react/query` exposes ready-made React Query hooks around every client in `@nouslabs/sdk`. Start by mounting `QubicProvider` and `QueryClientProvider`, then reach for the specialised hooks documented in this section.

## Minimal setup

```tsx
import { QubicProvider } from "@nouslabs/react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <QubicProvider>{children}</QubicProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

Once the providers are mounted, any component can call the hooks listed under **Hooks** and **Contracts** to fetch live data or cached smart contract responses.

## Next steps

- Review the [core hooks](./hooks) for tick, balance, transaction, and mutation helpers.
- Explore [contract-specific guides](./contracts) for deep integrations with each Qubic contract.
- Need something custom? Reach for `useContractQuery` from `@nouslabs/react/query/contracts` or the SDK primitives directly.
