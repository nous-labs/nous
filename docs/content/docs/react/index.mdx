# @nouslabs/react

`@nouslabs/react` packages the SDK into ergonomic hooks and context providers. It also exposes a full React Query integration (`@nouslabs/react/query`) with ready-made hooks for live data and smart contracts.

## Building blocks

- `QubicProvider` — exposes the live/query/archive clients via React context.
- `QubicAuthProvider` — optional layer for seed/vault/WalletConnect workflows.
- React Query helpers — documented throughout this section, including per-contract guides.

```tsx
import { QubicProvider } from "@nouslabs/react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <QubicProvider>{children}</QubicProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```
