# Support the Project

The Qubic TypeScript SDK is an open-source project maintained by dedicated developers who believe in making blockchain technology more accessible. Your support helps us continue improving the SDK, adding new features, and maintaining comprehensive documentation.

## Donation Address

If you find this SDK valuable and want to support its development, you can send QUBIC to our donation address:

<Callout type="info" title="Official Donation Address">

</Callout>

You can copy the address above and send any amount of QUBIC you'd like to contribute. Every donation, no matter how small, helps us dedicate more time to:

- üöÄ **New Features**: Implementing additional smart contract integrations and developer tools
