# Transactions

The SDK focuses on broadcasting and querying. Use it together with signing utilities (CLI or [qubic-core-lite](https://github.com/hackerby888/qubic-core-lite)) to submit transfers and contract calls.

## 1. Create a client

```ts
import { createQubicClient } from "@nouslabs/sdk";

const qubic = createQubicClient({
  liveUrl: process.env.NOUS_LIVE_URL,
});
```

## 2. Determine a target tick

```ts
const { tickInfo } = await qubic.live.getTickInfo();
const tick = tickInfo.tick + 5; // schedule a few ticks ahead
```

## 3. Build & sign the transaction

Use one of the following approaches:

- **CLI**: `nous transactions sign <to> <amount> --output signed.txt`
- **qubic-core-lite**: invoke its key derivation and signing helpers inside your Next.js/Node workflow.

qubic-core-lite exposes low-level primitives for KeyPair generation and transaction encoding. After compiling it (see Next.js scaffolding guide), call into the library to produce a base64 encoded payload.

## 4. Broadcast

```ts
const encoded = readFileSync("signed.txt", "utf8").trim(); // or output from qubic-core-lite

const result = await qubic.live.broadcast(encoded);

console.log("Transaction ID:", result.transactionId);
console.log("Peers broadcasted:", result.peersBroadcasted);
```

## Validation helpers

Use the SDK’s utilities before sending payloads:

```ts
import { identityToBytes, base64ToBytes } from "@nouslabs/sdk/utils";

identityToBytes(destinationIdentity); // throws if invalid
base64ToBytes(encoded); // ensures payload is valid base64
```

## Contract interactions

For smart contracts, qubic-core-lite can compile and deploy contracts while the SDK handles broadcasting and querying. Combine both to mirror wagmi’s `writeContract` + `waitForTransaction` pattern.
