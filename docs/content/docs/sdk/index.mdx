# @nouslabs/sdk

The TypeScript SDK provides clients for Qubic APIs, encoding utilities, wallet helpers, and optional React bindings. Use this section to dive into each feature area.

## What's included

- Utilities: encoding, identity validation, smart contract helpers
- Wallet helpers: seed, vault, WalletConnect, MetaMask Snap
- React bindings: see the dedicated React section for hooks and providers

## Suggested reading order

1. **Install** — add the SDK to your project and configure TypeScript.
2. **Clients** — learn when to use each API client.
3. **Wallet** — understand the authentication primitives.
4. **Transactions** — broadcast signed payloads (CLI or qubic-core-lite).
5. **Utilities** — mix and match helpers for encoding and contract queries.

Pair these guides with the CLI documentation for offline signing or the Next.js scaffolding tutorial for full-stack projects.
