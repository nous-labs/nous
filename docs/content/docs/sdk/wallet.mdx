# Wallet helpers

`@nouslabs/sdk/wallet` provides the primitives that power the CLI and React bindings. They mirror wagmi connectors and can be used in vanilla TypeScript projects.

## Seed session

```ts
import { createSeedSession } from "@nouslabs/sdk/wallet";

const session = await createSeedSession({
  seed: process.env.SEED!,
  label: "Ops wallet",
});

console.log(session.account.publicId); // derived identity (requires qubic-core-lite integration)
```

> **Note**: Low-level signing with seeds currently relies on the cryptographic primitives from [qubic-core-lite](https://github.com/hackerby888/qubic-core-lite). See the Next.js scaffolding guide for wiring both packages together.

## Vault session

Use vault helpers to decrypt `.qubic-vault` files in the browser or Node.

```ts
import { createVaultSession } from "@nouslabs/sdk/wallet";

const vaultFile = await fetch("/secrets/team.qubic-vault").then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer(),
);

const session = await createVaultSession({
  file: new File([vaultFile], "team.qubic-vault"),
  password: process.env.VAULT_PASSWORD!,
});
```

## WalletConnect

```ts
import {
  connectWalletConnect,
  createWalletConnectSession,
} from "@nouslabs/sdk/wallet";

const connection = await connectWalletConnect({
  projectId: process.env.WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID!,
  metadata: {
    name: "QTS Playground",
    description: "Build with Qubic",
    url: "https://localhost:3000",
    icons: ["https://localhost:3000/icon.png"],
  },
});

// Present connection.uri in your QR modal of choice
const session = await connection.waitForApproval();

// Later, resume a signed session
const restored = await createWalletConnectSession({
  projectId: process.env.WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID!,
});
```

## MetaMask Snap

Call `authenticate("metamask")` from the React bindings or use the lower-level helpers to talk to a Qubic Snap. The wallet module exposes `detectWalletProviders()` to locate injected providers.

```ts
import { detectWalletProviders, WalletAdapter } from "@nouslabs/sdk/wallet";

const [provider] = detectWalletProviders();
const adapter = new WalletAdapter(provider.provider);

const accounts = await adapter.connect();
```

## Extending with qubic-core-lite

For smart-contract execution and Schnorr signing, clone [qubic-core-lite](https://github.com/hackerby888/qubic-core-lite) alongside your app (for example under `contracts/qubic-core-lite`). Build the native tooling, then call its utilities to derive identities and sign payloads before broadcasting them with `qubic.live.broadcast`.

See the Next.js scaffolding guide for a full integration that compiles contracts and triggers transactions end-to-end.
