## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- **WalletConnect + React signing helpers**: extended the adapter and `useWalletConnect()` hook to sign raw transactions and typed procedures, plus new `signAndBroadcastProcedureCall` utilities.
- **Procedure builder API**: `createProcedure`, `defineProcedure`, and `procedureCallToTransaction` make it possible to encode contract procedures safely and feed the payload into any wallet integration.
- **Contract metadata exports**: `QUBIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES` exposes the canonical on-chain identity for each contract, mirroring the explorer list.
- **Docs enhancements**: refreshed the Smart Contracts guide with contract indexes, addresses, and procedure examples; wallet/front-end guides now document the new signing flow.

### Changed
- **Canonical contract ordering**: `QUBIC_CONTRACTS` matches the upstream `core/contracts` definition, including aliases such as `MLM`, `QTRY`, `SWATCH`, etc., ensuring procedure/identity mapping stays correct.
- **Integration tests**: now reference the published contract identity instead of a deprecated address, keeping CI green against live RPC endpoints.

### Fixed
- TypeScript compatibility for WalletConnect by importing the concrete client instance (fixes `tsc --noEmit`).
- Minor docs typos and outdated references (removed the unfinished playground links).

## Migration Guides

### From Direct API Calls

<Callout type="info">
If you were previously making direct HTTP requests to Qubic APIs, the SDK simplifies your code significantly.
</Callout>

**Before:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://rpc.qubic.org/v1/tick-info');
const data = await response.json();
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error('Request failed');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { QubicLiveClient } from '@nvlabs/qts';
const client = new QubicLiveClient();
const { tickInfo } = await client.getTickInfo();
```

### From Archive API to Query API

<Callout type="warn">
Many Archive API endpoints are deprecated. Migrate to QueryClient for new features and better performance.
</Callout>

| Deprecated (ArchiveClient) | Recommended (QueryClient) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `getLatestTick()` | `getLastProcessedTick()` |
| `getStatus()` | `getProcessedTickIntervals()` |
| `getComputors()` | `getComputorsListForEpoch()` |
| `getTransaction()` | `getTransactionByHash()` |
| `getTickTransactions()` | `getTransactionsForTick()` |
| `getTransferTransactionsPerTick()` | `getTransactionsForIdentity()` |

**Migration Example:**

```typescript
// Old (Deprecated)
const { transaction } = await archive.getTransaction(txId);

// New (Recommended)
const { transaction } = await query.getTransactionByHash(txId);
```

---

## Deprecation Notices

### ArchiveClient Methods

The following methods will be removed in **v2.0.0**:

- `getLatestTick()` → Use `QueryClient.getLastProcessedTick()` or `QubicLiveClient.getTickInfo()`
- `getStatus()` → Use `QueryClient.getProcessedTickIntervals()`
- `getComputors()` → Use `QueryClient.getComputorsListForEpoch()`
- `getTransaction()` → Use `QueryClient.getTransactionByHash()`
- `getTickTransactions()` → Use `QueryClient.getTransactionsForTick()`
- `getTransferTransactionsPerTick()` → Use `QueryClient.getTransactionsForIdentity()`

<Callout type="error">
**Action Required**: If you're using ArchiveClient, please migrate to QueryClient to ensure compatibility with future versions.
</Callout>
