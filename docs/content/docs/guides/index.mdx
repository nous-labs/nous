# Advanced Guides

The base docs explain *what* each client does, while this section focuses on the **decisions** you have to make in
production: how you organise queries, deal with latency, and cross-wire contracts. Each guide is self-contained, so you
can jump directly to whatever task you are automating.

<Callout type="info" title="Everything is still MDX">
  The advanced guides reuse the same component set as the rest of the documentation, so feel free to embed snippets,
  tabs, or even interactive sandboxes if you expand on them.
